# Build macOS App

Build, audit, or ship native macOS SwiftUI/AppKit apps with HIG compliance, Liquid Glass visual treatment, expectation-first visual validation, Swift quality hooks, and optional Convex + Clerk cloud sync.

This file is the spine. Match the request to one Operation in the table below, then load only the references for that branch — do not preload the whole tree.

## When to use this skill

Trigger on any of:

- Native macOS app work: new app scaffolds, feature implementation, redesigns, audits, migrations, release prep, or quality setup.
- SwiftUI/AppKit projects with `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift`, or Swift files that include a macOS app target.
- macOS UI concerns: menus, keyboard shortcuts, windows, sidebars, toolbars, settings, accessibility, HIG conformance, Liquid Glass, snapshot tests, SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, or pre-commit hooks.
- Multi-platform Apple repos when a macOS target exists.
- Convex + Clerk Swift client work when the app has a macOS surface.

Example user phrases that should trigger this skill:

- *"Make this Mac app feel native — it looks like an iOS app on a Mac."*
- *"Audit this SwiftUI macOS app against the HIG and the Liquid Glass guidelines."*
- *"Migrate this Mac app from macOS 14 to Tahoe / macOS 26."*
- *"Wire SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, and a pre-commit hook into this Swift repo."*
- *"Add `swift-snapshot-testing` to this macOS app and capture screenshots in CI."*
- *"Hook up Convex + Clerk to my SwiftUI Mac app with reactive queries and SIWA."*
- *"Build a `MenuBarExtra` app with Settings, command menu, and Cmd-Q wired up."*
- *"Why does this Liquid Glass toolbar look wrong on macOS 26?"*
- *"Pre-release checklist for shipping this Mac app."*

Do NOT use this skill for:

- iOS-only, iPadOS-only, visionOS-only, watchOS-only, or tvOS-only work without a macOS target.
- Generic Swift package work with no app, UI, or macOS surface (use the language-level skill set).
- Pure server-side Convex, TypeScript, or backend-only work — even if the same product has a Mac client, route backend-only requests away.
- Non-Apple Swift on Linux, Windows, or server-side Swift.
- Browser automation or web snapshot testing — route to browser or Playwright skills.
- Catalyst-only or Intel-Mac targets for the Convex + Clerk path (current ConvexMobile is Apple Silicon only).
- Generic Swift quality-hook setup for a repo with no macOS target — the per-platform references for iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS exist *only* to support multi-platform Apple repos that also include macOS.

If a request is ambiguous (e.g. "I'm building an Apple app"), confirm there is a macOS target before engaging.

## Platform Stance

| Scope | Rule |
|---|---|
| Primary scope | Native macOS SwiftUI/AppKit apps. |
| Multi-platform repos | In scope only when a macOS target exists. |
| Out of scope | iOS-only, iPadOS-only, visionOS-only, watchOS-only, tvOS-only, non-Apple Swift, and pure server-side Convex. |
| Liquid Glass target | macOS 26+ with the Xcode 26 SDK. |
| Backward-compatible target | macOS 14+ with availability guards where Liquid Glass or Clerk paths require them. |
| Clerk + Convex path | Apple Silicon macOS only per current ConvexMobile limitations. |

## HIG vs Liquid Glass

HIG is the baseline that always applies. Liquid Glass is an additive, version-gated visual treatment layered on top of an HIG-correct view — never a substitute for it.

| Decision | Apply |
|---|---|
| Interaction, menus, windows, keyboard shortcuts, settings, accessibility, typography, spacing, and standard controls | HIG is always the baseline. |
| macOS 26 / Tahoe-era visual treatment for navigation, chrome, toolbars, sidebars, floating controls, sheets, popovers, and overlays | Liquid Glass may apply *after* HIG is satisfied. |
| Content rows, text, tables, form fields, cards, and data surfaces | Never apply glass. Keep content readable and semantically styled. |
| macOS 14/15 support | Gate Liquid Glass APIs with `#available(macOS 26, *)`; provide `NSVisualEffectView` or standard SwiftUI fallbacks. |

## Operations

Detect the operation from the user's request, then load the narrowest reference set. Each row routes to the entry point — that file may fan out into siblings, but the spine never preloads them.

| Operation | Trigger phrase / signal | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap | New macOS app, fresh project, or first production scaffold | [references/workflow/bootstrap-new-app.md](references/workflow/bootstrap-new-app.md) |
| Build | "Add a screen / view / window / command", any new feature on an existing app | Apply the Three Questions, then route by subsystem in HIG / Liquid Glass routing tables below |
| Redesign | "Make it native", "Apple-like", "Tahoe-ready", "make it Liquid Glass" | [references/liquid-glass/design-diagnosis.md](references/liquid-glass/design-diagnosis.md) |
| Audit | "Review", "assess", "find issues", "preflight", "lint the design" | [references/workflow/audit-existing.md](references/workflow/audit-existing.md) |
| Migrate | Pre-Tahoe code (macOS 14/15) moving to macOS 26 | [references/liquid-glass/migration-guide.md](references/liquid-glass/migration-guide.md) |
| Install hooks | "Set up SwiftLint / SwiftFormat / pre-commit / CI quality" | [references/quality-hooks/hook-architecture.md](references/quality-hooks/hook-architecture.md) |
| Add visual tests | "Snapshot tests", "screenshot validation", "visual diff" | [references/visual-validation/snapshot-testing-spm.md](references/visual-validation/snapshot-testing-spm.md) |
| Wire cloud sync | Convex, Clerk, real-time queries, subscriptions, or auth-gated data | [references/cloud-sync/overview.md](references/cloud-sync/overview.md) |
| Ship | Release checklist, App Store, direct distribution, notarization | [references/workflow/ship-checklist.md](references/workflow/ship-checklist.md) |

If the requested operation is ambiguous, make the smallest reasonable assumption and proceed; do not stall for confirmation on routine work.

## Core Guardrails

These four rules and the Three Questions are the gate every Build operation must pass before any view code is written or modified.

### Three Laws Of macOS UI

1. Every action must be reachable from the menu bar; toolbars are optional chrome. See [references/hig/components/menus.md](references/hig/components/menus.md).
2. Standard keyboard shortcuts are reserved: `Cmd-N/O/S/Shift-S/Z/Shift-Z/Q/W/Comma/F/A/C/V/X`. See [references/hig/platform/keyboard-shortcuts.md](references/hig/platform/keyboard-shortcuts.md).
3. Settings take effect immediately. No Save, Cancel, or Apply buttons in preferences. See [references/hig/components/menus.md](references/hig/components/menus.md).

### Three Questions Before Any View

1. Is this navigation or content?
2. What is the one primary action?
3. Would this feel native beside Finder, Mail, Photos, or Settings?

If a request would violate any of the Three Laws, or any of the Three Questions has no clear answer, redesign before writing code.

## HIG Reference Routing

Open the row that matches the topic in the request. Foundations cover *how things look*; components cover *individual controls*; platform covers *window-level structure*; technologies covers *system integrations*.

| Practitioner overrides and common real-world judgment calls | [references/hig/practitioner-insights.md](references/hig/practitioner-insights.md) |

## Liquid Glass Routing

Read these only after HIG is satisfied for the view in question. Glass is a finishing layer, not a structural one.

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| SwiftUI and AppKit API surface | [references/liquid-glass/api-reference.md](references/liquid-glass/api-reference.md) |
| Navigation/content divide, concentricity, tint hierarchy | [references/liquid-glass/design-principles.md](references/liquid-glass/design-principles.md) |

| AppKit and SwiftUI bridge choices | [references/liquid-glass/appkit-bridging.md](references/liquid-glass/appkit-bridging.md) |

Liquid Glass references carry WWDC 2025 session context. Do not duplicate session lists in the spine.

## Visual Validation Routing

Expectation-first discipline (decide what should be true, then look) is separate from the pixel-diff library (the SPM tool that captures and compares images). Use both; do not skip the discipline.

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Expectation-first loop and report buckets | [references/visual-validation/expectation-loop.md](references/visual-validation/expectation-loop.md) |
| Capture-mode selection for native, hybrid, and fallback paths | [references/visual-validation/capture-modes.md](references/visual-validation/capture-modes.md) |
| Drift taxonomy and narrowest-layer fix choice | [references/visual-validation/drift-analysis.md](references/visual-validation/drift-analysis.md) |
| Point-Free `swift-snapshot-testing` SPM wiring, record/verify mode, CI artifacts | [references/visual-validation/snapshot-testing-spm.md](references/visual-validation/snapshot-testing-spm.md) |
| Blank screenshots, focus failures, permissions, unstable runners | [references/visual-validation/troubleshooting.md](references/visual-validation/troubleshooting.md) |

## Quality Hooks Routing

Hard guardrails:

- Never write to `.git/hooks/` directly; use `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- Never enable typecheck stage by default; opt in with `SWIFT_HOOK_TYPECHECK=1`.
- Never install global tools without confirmation.
- Never commit an empty SwiftLint baseline as a legacy-project solution.
- Never claim typecheck works without running it once end to end.

Copy the bundled assets from the outer skill root into the target repo:

| Source | Destination | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/swiftlint.yml` | `.swiftlint.yml` | SwiftLint rules and custom rules |
| `assets/swiftformat` | `.swiftformat` | SwiftFormat allowlist |
| `assets/githooks/pre-commit` | `.githooks/pre-commit` | Staged Swift lint/format/typecheck hook |
| `assets/scripts/swift-typecheck.sh` | `scripts/swift-typecheck.sh` | Per-platform `xcodebuild` matrix |
| `assets/Makefile.fragment` | append to `Makefile` | Lint, format, hook install targets |
| `assets/github-workflows/swift-quality.yml` | `.github/workflows/swift-quality.yml` | CI matrix and snapshot artifacts |

## Cloud Sync Routing

Engage only when `Package.swift` or the request mentions `ConvexMobile`, `ClerkKit`, `ClerkConvex`, Convex, Clerk, real-time queries, multi-device sync, auth-gated cloud data, or live subscriptions. Skip this track for local-only Core Data or SwiftData apps.

Default stance:

- Use Clerk as the default Swift auth path.
- Treat `clerk-convex-swift >= 0.1.0`, `clerk-ios >= 1.0.0`, and `convex-swift >= 0.8.0` as minimum supported bounds; use version audit notes in [references/cloud-sync/operations/verified-corrections.md](references/cloud-sync/operations/verified-corrections.md) for latest checked versions.
- Prefer one `@MainActor` long-lived authenticated client per process: `ConvexClientWithAuth(deploymentUrl:authProvider: ClerkConvexAuthProvider())`.
- Use `AuthView()` and `UserButton()` from `ClerkKitUI`; do not roll a manual SIWA flow around `ASAuthorizationController`.
- Treat the Swift SDK as reconnecting-online, not offline-first.
- Treat macOS support as Apple Silicon only through this stack.

Hard rules:

- Do not promise optimistic updates, native offline persistence, Catalyst, Intel Mac, watchOS, tvOS, or visionOS support for ConvexMobile.
- Do not trust client-passed `userId` values. Server-side Clerk JWT identity is the authorization boundary.
- Do not use `Date.now()` inside Convex queries; pass stable client timestamps.
- Do not assume a subscription recovers after terminal Combine failure; rebuild with `resubscribe()`.
- Do not declare subscription-owning view models at the App scene level on macOS; use per-window or in-hierarchy ownership.

Cloud-sync UI still obeys HIG and Liquid Glass rules: loading states use skeletons or tri-state UI, errors provide a specific retry path, auth UI lives in sheets/toolbars where appropriate, and sync status belongs in subtle chrome rather than content rows.

## Workflow Routing

Use these only when the operation in the request is a whole-app workflow (bootstrap, audit, ship) rather than a single-view change.

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap a new app end to end | [references/workflow/bootstrap-new-app.md](references/workflow/bootstrap-new-app.md) |
| Audit existing code with severity-tagged findings | [references/workflow/audit-existing.md](references/workflow/audit-existing.md) |
| Run final pre-release checks | [references/workflow/ship-checklist.md](references/workflow/ship-checklist.md) |

## Output Contract

Every session that uses this skill ends with a single report block. Do not pad it; do not omit it.

Report:

- **What changed:** file paths plus one line per change. Group related edits.
- **Verification rung reached** — claim the highest rung actually exercised, no more:

  | Rung | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | 1 | Read the code |
  | 2 | Type-check or lint passes |
  | 3 | Unit tests pass |
  | 4 | Snapshot tests pass |
  | 5 | Ran the program and observed the change |
  | 6 | User confirmed the changed behavior |

- **What remains** — only if anything remains. Be specific (file path, intended next rung, blocker).

Never claim done while the working tree is dirty, a guardrail in this skill is violated, or the stated verification rung was not actually reached. If a Liquid Glass change was made but never run on a macOS 26 device or simulator, claim Rung 2 — not Rung 5.
