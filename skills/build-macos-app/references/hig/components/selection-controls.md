## 1. Checkboxes

### What It Is

A checkbox is a small square control that toggles a single, independent Boolean setting on or off. It uses a check mark glyph when selected and is blank when unselected. When representing a mixed state — where subordinate options are only partially selected — it displays a dash (–).

AppKit class: `NSButton` with `buttonType = .switch` (enum: `NSButtonTypeSwitch`). Note: the AppKit type name is `NSSwitchButton`; this is distinct from `NSSwitch` (the toggle/slider control).

### Dimensions

The physical dimensions of each size tier are fixed by the system; you do not set them manually. Values below are the canonical pixel measurements from the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (Mac OS X era, confirmed in the layout guide):

| Size    | Box dimensions (approx.) | Label font          |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Regular | 18 × 18 px (incl. shadow)| System font         |
| Small   | 14 × 16 px               | Small system font   |
| Mini    | 15 × 15 px               | Mini system font    |

Source: AWS-hosted Apple HIG PDF (2005 edition) snippet confirmed through web search snippet at position #1: "Size: Full size: 18 x 18 pixels, including the shadow. Small: 14 x 16 pixels. Mini: 15 x 15 pixels."

### Spacing

| Context                                     | Regular | Small | Mini |
|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------|------|
| Introductory label (same line, colon to control) | 8 px | 6 px | 5 px |
| Introductory label above group (label to first checkbox) | 8 px | 8 px | 8 px |
| Between stacked checkboxes                  | 8 px    | 8 px  | 7 px |

Align the baseline of the introductory label with the baseline of the first checkbox's label.

### States

| State       | Visual appearance                                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Unselected  | Empty square box                                        |
| Selected    | Square box with check mark glyph                        |
| Mixed       | Square box with a dash (–) — indicates partial selection of subordinate items |
| Disabled    | Dimmed (all states); the check mark or dash is still visible but grayed |
| Hover       | The HIG does not specify a distinct hover appearance for checkboxes on macOS |

#### Mixed State (indeterminate)

Enabled via `NSButton.allowsMixedState = true`. The cycle order is: unchecked → checked → mixed → unchecked. If you want the user to not directly cycle into mixed state on click, you must intercept the action and programmatically set the state. Use mixed state only when the checkbox controls subordinate checkboxes and some (but not all) subordinate items are checked.

### Grouping Rules

- Independent checkboxes: align all at the same leading edge; they all appear to be at the same visual level.
- Hierarchical (dependent) checkboxes: indent subordinate checkboxes under the controlling one to show the dependency relationship.
- Checkboxes are appropriate for multi-select (more than one item can be on at once). For single-selection from a set, use radio buttons.

### Keyboard Behavior

- Tab moves focus to the checkbox.
- Space bar toggles the focused checkbox.
- The full clickable target includes the label text, not just the box.

## 2. Radio Buttons

### What It Is

A group of radio buttons presents a set of mutually exclusive, related choices — the user can select exactly one at a time. AppKit class: `NSButton` with `buttonType = .radio` (enum: `NSButtonTypeRadio`).

Grouping behavior: buttons in the same superview sharing the same target action are automatically grouped by AppKit. The deprecated `NSMatrix` class previously handled grouping; current apps use individual `NSButton` instances with `.radio` type.

### Dimensions

Same three size tiers as checkboxes; the button circle dimensions are fixed per size. No public numeric pixel value is provided in the modern HIG text, but the size tier system (regular / small / mini) is confirmed.

### Spacing

| Context                                     | Regular | Small | Mini |
|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------|------|
| Introductory label (colon to first button)  | 8 px    | 6 px  | 5 px |
| Between buttons stacked vertically          | 6 px    | 6 px  | 5 px |

Horizontal arrangement: measure the space needed for the longest radio button label, then use that measurement to space each pair consistently (the HIG specifies no fixed pixel value for horizontal spacing beyond this rule).

### States

| State       | Visual appearance                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Unselected  | Empty circle                           |
| Selected    | Circle with filled dot                 |
| Disabled    | Dimmed; filled dot or empty circle visible but grayed |
| Hover       | Not specified distinctly by the HIG    |

Radio buttons are never dynamic: the contents and labels must not change based on context. A radio button should never directly initiate an action — it changes the state of the application, which may then cause secondary UI changes.

### Grouping Rules

- Minimum 2 items per group.
- Maximum ~5 items per group. If you need more than 5 mutually exclusive options, use a pop-up menu instead.
- Arrange vertically whenever possible; vertical stacking communicates the mutual-exclusion relationship more clearly.
- A single radio button alone is always wrong — use a checkbox for a single binary choice.

### Keyboard Behavior

- Tab moves focus into the group.
- Arrow keys move focus and selection among buttons within the group.
- Space bar selects the currently focused button.

## 3. Toggles / Switches (NSSwitch)

### What It Is

`NSSwitch` is a dedicated AppKit control introduced in **macOS 10.15 Catalina** that renders as a pill-shaped sliding switch (similar to iOS UISwitch). It is not a subclass of `NSButton` — it is its own class. It controls a Boolean (on/off) state and executes the change **immediately**, with no separate Apply/Save step.

> The MacKuba NSButton style guide (2014, updated for Catalina) explicitly notes: "Switch Control (NSSwitch) — macOS 10.15 (Catalina) — introduced with Catalina."

In SwiftUI on macOS, `Toggle` renders as an `NSSwitch` by default.

### macOS Availability

- `NSSwitch`: macOS 10.15 Catalina and later.
- `Toggle` (SwiftUI, `.toggleStyle(.switch)`): macOS 10.15 and later.
- Before Catalina: simulate with `NSButton` using `.pushOnPushOff` button type in a rounded bezel, or use a checkbox.

### Sizing

`NSSwitch` has a fixed intrinsic size set by the system. It does not offer regular/small/mini variants in the same way `NSButton` does. The exact pixel dimensions are not published in the HIG text, but the control is visually proportioned to align with regular-size AppKit controls in standard list/form layouts.

### States

| State    | Visual                                        |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Off      | Pill outlined, thumb on left (leading side)    |
| On       | Pill filled with accent color, thumb on right  |
| Disabled | Dimmed; thumb position reflects last state     |

### Interaction

- Single click/tap flips the state immediately.
- The change takes effect without a separate confirmation.
- On keyboard: Tab to focus, Space to toggle.

### When to Use (macOS HIG Direct Quotes)

> "Avoid using a switch to control a single detail or a minor setting. A switch has more visual weight than a checkbox, so it looks better when it controls more functionality than a checkbox typically does."

> "Use a checkbox instead of a switch if you need to present a hierarchy of settings. The visual style of checkboxes helps them align well and communicate grouping."

> "If you're already using a checkbox in your interface, it's probably best to keep using it." (HIG guidance on consistency within a single UI)

**Source:** Apple HIG, Toggles page (`/components/selection-and-input/toggles#macos`), confirmed via Reddit r/MacOS thread (June 2022) quoting the live HIG text verbatim.

### Practical Rule

Use `NSSwitch` when:
- The setting is a major feature-level on/off (e.g., "Enable Notifications", "Bluetooth On/Off").
- The change takes effect immediately (no Apply button).
- The control stands alone — not nested under or alongside other checkboxes.

Do not use `NSSwitch` when:
- The setting is a minor or detail-level option.
- You have a list of related Boolean options where alignment and visual grouping matter (use checkboxes instead).
- You are building a form that requires a final Submit/Apply action.

## 4. Date & Time Pickers

### What It Is

`NSDatePicker` is the AppKit control for date and time input. It supports three distinct visual styles, selectable via the `datePickerStyle` property (Swift: `NSDatePicker.Style`).

### Styles

#### Style 1: `textFieldAndStepper` (textual, classic)

- **Appearance:** A segmented text field showing date/time components (month, day, year, hour, minute, second) alongside a stepper control (up/down arrows).
- **Interaction:** Click a field segment to select it; type a new value or click the stepper arrows to increment/decrement. Arrow keys also work on a focused segment.
- **Use when:** Space is constrained and you need precise, field-by-field date/time entry. Appropriate for settings panels, inspector windows, and forms.
- **Configurability:** Can display date only, time only, or both. Date format can be month+day+year or month+year only. Time format can be h:mm or h:mm:ss.

#### Style 2: `clockAndCalendar` (graphical)

- **Appearance:** An analog clock face + a monthly calendar grid, displayed inline or in a popover.
- **Interaction:** Click the left/right arrows in the calendar to navigate months; click a day to select it. Drag the clock hands to set the time. Can show calendar only, clock only, or both together.
- **Use when:** You want users to browse visually through a calendar or when a clock-face metaphor fits the app's style. Appropriate when the user is choosing a future date rather than entering a known date.
- **API enum:** `NSDatePicker.Style.clockAndCalendar` — confirmed available macOS 10.12+.

#### Style 3: `textField` (text field only, no stepper)

- **Appearance:** Text field displaying the date/time as text, without stepper arrows.
- **Interaction:** Direct text entry only.
- **Use when:** The interface provides its own adjacent controls, or when the stepper would be redundant.

### Keyboard Behavior

- In `textFieldAndStepper`: Tab selects the next date component within the picker; arrow keys adjust the focused component. The embedded stepper also receives arrow key events.
- In `clockAndCalendar`: Arrow keys navigate the calendar grid.

### API Notes

- Class: `NSDatePicker`
- `datePickerMode`: `.single` (one date) or `.range` (date range)
- `datePickerElements`: bit-mask controlling which components are shown (`yearMonthDay`, `hourMinuteSecond`, etc.)
- `calendar`, `locale`, `timeZone`: fully configurable

## 5. Sliders

### What It Is

A slider (`NSSlider`) lets users choose from a continuous range of values by dragging a thumb along a track. macOS supports two distinct slider types: **linear** and **circular**.

### Linear Sliders

Linear sliders can be oriented horizontally or vertically. The thumb can be **directional** (pointing at the track, best with tick marks) or **round** (best without tick marks).

#### Dimensions — Horizontal Orientation (height is the fixed dimension)

| Size  | Thumb style   | Without tick marks | With tick marks |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Regular | Directional  | 19 px tall         | 25 px tall      |
| Regular | Round        | 15 px tall         | N/A             |
| Small   | Directional  | 14 px tall         | 19 px tall      |
| Small   | Round        | 12 px tall         | N/A             |
| Mini    | Directional  | 11 px tall         | 17 px tall      |
| Mini    | Round        | 10 px tall         | N/A             |

#### Dimensions — Vertical Orientation (width is the fixed dimension)

| Size  | Thumb style   | Without tick marks | With tick marks |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Regular | Directional  | 18 px wide         | 24 px wide      |
| Regular | Round        | 15 px wide         | N/A             |
| Small   | Directional  | 14 px wide         | 19 px wide      |
| Small   | Round        | 11 px wide         | N/A             |
| Mini    | Directional  | 11 px wide         | 17 px wide      |
| Mini    | Round        | 10 px wide         | N/A             |

**Source:** Apple Human Interface Guidelines — Mac OS X Controls chapter (leopard-adc.pepas.com mirror), verified text extract.

#### Tick Marks

- When tick marks are present, Interface Builder automatically switches the thumb from round to directional.
- Label at minimum and maximum tick mark positions at a minimum. If intervals are unequal, label interior marks too.
- Range label font: Label font (regular/small sizes), 9-point label font (mini).

#### Spacing Between Multiple Stacked Sliders

| Size    | Minimum gap |
|---------|-------------|
| Regular | 12 px       |
| Small   | 10 px       |
| Mini    | 8 px        |

### Circular Sliders

#### Dimensions (diameter is the fixed dimension)

| Size    | Without tick marks | With tick marks |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Regular | 24 px diameter     | 32 px diameter  |
| Small   | 18 px diameter     | 22 px diameter  |

Note: circular sliders are available in regular and small only (no mini size).

The thumb of a circular slider is a small circular dimple. Users drag it clockwise or counter-clockwise. Tick marks, when present, appear as evenly spaced dots around the circumference.

**Use circular sliders** when the value represents an angle or a cyclical quantity (e.g., rotation angle, direction of a drop shadow). The circular metaphor mirrors real-world angular controls.

### States

| State    | Behavior                                               |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal   | Thumb is draggable; track accepts clicks               |
| Disabled | Track and thumb are dimmed; value is read-only         |

Sliders support live dragging (continuous feedback as the user drags). You can also opt into `isContinuous = false` for commit-on-release behavior.

### Keyboard Behavior

- Tab to focus the slider.
- Arrow keys adjust the value by one step. Option+Arrow adjusts by a larger increment (10 steps by default).
- Page Up / Page Down also adjust by larger increments.

### API Class

`NSSlider`

## 6. Steppers

### What It Is

A stepper (`NSStepper`) — also called "little arrows" — consists of two small up/down (or +/–) buttons that increment or decrement a numeric value. It is almost always paired with a text field that shows the current value. The text field may or may not be editable by the user directly.

### Dimensions

The stepper control has a fixed size per size tier; no numeric pixel values are published in the modern HIG. The historical HIG (Mac OS X era) references a figure (`ct_small_arrows.jpg`) showing a regular-size stepper without publishing the pixel height/width in text. From AppKit intrinsic size behavior: regular is approximately 15 × 27 px (width × height), matching what developers observe in Xcode Interface Builder.

### Spacing

| Size    | Gap between stepper and its text field |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| Regular | 2 px                                   |
| Small   | 2 px                                   |
| Mini    | 1 px                                   |

**Source:** Apple HIG Controls chapter (leopard-adc.pepas.com), confirmed text extract.

### Behavior

- Clicking the up button increments the value; clicking the down button decrements it.
- Clicking and holding accelerates the rate of change.
- Values wrap around if `wraps = true` (e.g., 359° → 0° in a degree field).
- `minValue` and `maxValue` clamp the range.
- The stepper fires its action message on each click (or on each increment when held).

### Pairing with a Text Field

- Always place the stepper immediately adjacent (2 px gap) to its text field.
- The text field displays the current value. When the user edits the text field directly, update the stepper's value to match on the text field's action.
- Use `NSValueFormatter` on the text field to enforce valid input.

### Keyboard Behavior

- Tab focuses the adjacent text field first; the stepper itself can receive focus.
- Up/Down arrow keys on a focused stepper increment/decrement the value.

### When to Use vs. Slider

Use a stepper when:
- The value is discrete (whole numbers or fixed increments).
- The exact value must be precisely controllable (e.g., page number, point size, port number).
- The full range would be inconvenient to represent visually as a track.

Use a slider when:
- The value is continuous or nearly so.
- Real-time visual feedback while dragging is valuable (e.g., volume, brightness).
- Precise entry is less important than quick approximate selection.

## 7. Color Wells

### What It Is

A color well (`NSColorWell`) is a small rectangular control that displays the currently selected color. Clicking it opens a color picker so the user can change the color. Multiple color wells can appear in the same window (e.g., fill color, stroke color, shadow color in a document inspector).

### Default Behavior (classic style)

- Click to open the system Colors panel (`NSColorPanel`).
- Dragging a color from one color well and dropping onto another color well copies the color.
- `NSColorWell` fires its action whenever the user changes the color in the panel.
- The well is a live target: it reflects the panel's current color selection in real time.

### Styles (macOS 13 Ventura and later)

Starting with macOS 13, `NSColorWell` gained a `style` property with three options:

| Style                      | API enum                      | Behavior |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| Default (expanded)         | `NSColorWell.Style.expanded`  | Shows the color swatch plus a small dedicated button to open the full Colors panel. Also supports a popover with a quick color picker for faster interactions. |
| Pull-down                  | `NSColorWell.Style.pullDown`  | Single control; clicking it opens a color picker popover directly. Long-press or secondary click reveals the full Colors panel. |
| Minimal                    | `NSColorWell.Style.minimal`   | Displays only the color swatch rectangle. Clicking opens a popover color picker. Most compact; best for dense inspector layouts. |

Source: Apple Developer Documentation — `NSColorWell.Style.expanded` and `.minimal` pages.

### Sizing

The color well's size is not specified in pixels by Apple's documentation. In practice, the default well is sized at approximately 44 × 23 px at regular size in Interface Builder. You can resize it — both width and height are adjustable. Wider wells are more touch-friendly; narrow wells work better in dense inspector panels.

### States

| State    | Visual                                              |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Normal   | Solid rectangle filled with the current color       |
| Active   | Bordered/highlighted (border color changes on click)|
| Disabled | Dimmed swatch; click does not open the panel        |

### API Class

`NSColorWell`

## 8. Decision Trees

### Decision Tree 1: Checkbox vs. Toggle (NSSwitch)

```
Is the setting a major, feature-level on/off toggle?
  YES → Does it take effect immediately, with no Apply button?
          YES → Is it a standalone control (not part of a list of related checkboxes)?
                  YES → Use NSSwitch (Toggle)
                  NO  → Use Checkbox (the list's visual alignment wins)
          NO  → Use Checkbox (the deferred-apply context is wrong for a switch)
  NO  → Is it a minor/detail-level setting?
          YES → Use Checkbox
  
Is there a hierarchy of related Boolean options?
  YES → Use Checkboxes (with indentation for dependencies)

Is this in a form that requires a final Submit or Apply button?
  YES → Use Checkboxes
```

**Principle:** A switch implies immediate effect. A checkbox implies a choice to be confirmed or a state that is part of a larger form. A switch carries more visual weight — reserve it for settings that merit that weight.

### Decision Tree 2: Slider vs. Stepper

```
Is the value continuous (or nearly so)?
  YES → Is real-time visual feedback useful while the user drags?
          YES → Use Slider
          NO  → Consider Stepper if the value is discrete

Is the value discrete (specific increments, whole numbers)?
  YES → Does the user need to see the exact numeric value clearly?
          YES → Use Stepper + Text Field
          NO  → Slider with tick marks is acceptable

Is the range large (e.g., 0–1000)?
  YES → Is approximate selection acceptable?
          YES → Use Slider
          NO  → Use Stepper + Text Field (or text field alone)
  NO  → Slider or Stepper both work; prefer slider for visual ranges

Does the value represent an angle or cyclical quantity?
  YES → Use Circular Slider
```

### Decision Tree 3: Radio Buttons vs. Pop-up Menu vs. Segmented Control

```
Mutually exclusive options — how many?
  2–5 items → Are they visible simultaneously and spatially stable?
                YES → Radio Buttons (best affordance, always visible)
                NO  → Pop-up Menu (saves space)
  5+ items  → Pop-up Menu

Should selection trigger immediate re-layout of adjacent UI?
  YES → Radio Buttons (visibility of all options helps users anticipate the change)

Is this inside a toolbar or compact bar?
  YES → Segmented Control

Is space severely constrained?
  YES → Pop-up Menu
```

### Decision Tree 4: Date Picker Style

```
Is space constrained (narrow panel, settings sheet)?
  YES → Use textFieldAndStepper style

Does the user need to browse through dates visually?
  YES → Use clockAndCalendar style

Is the user entering a known date (e.g., date of birth)?
  YES → textFieldAndStepper or textField style (direct entry is faster)

Do you need to display only time (no date)?
  YES → Set datePickerElements to time-only; use textFieldAndStepper or clockAndCalendar (clock only)
```

### Decision Tree 5: Checkbox vs. Radio Button

```
Can more than one option be selected simultaneously?
  YES → Checkboxes

Must exactly one option be selected at all times?
  YES → Radio Buttons

Is this a single yes/no question?
  YES → Single Checkbox (never use a single radio button)

Are the options mutually exclusive AND more than 5?
  YES → Pop-up Menu
```

## 9. Dos and Don'ts

### Checkboxes

- **Do** use checkboxes for independent Boolean options in forms or preference panels.
- **Do** support mixed state when the checkbox controls a group of subordinate checkboxes.
- **Do** align checkbox leading edges vertically so the column reads cleanly.
- **Do** indent dependent (child) checkboxes under their controlling (parent) checkbox.
- **Don't** use a single radio button where a checkbox is appropriate.
- **Don't** use a checkbox where the action has immediate, significant consequences without an Apply step — a toggle/switch is clearer in that context.
- **Don't** change checkbox labels dynamically based on context.

### Radio Buttons

- **Do** use radio buttons for mutually exclusive choices from a small, stable set (2–5 items).
- **Do** arrange radio buttons vertically unless you have a strong spatial reason for horizontal layout.
- **Do** pre-select a default option — never leave a radio group with nothing selected.
- **Don't** use a single radio button alone.
- **Don't** use radio buttons if you have more than ~5 options; use a pop-up menu instead.
- **Don't** use radio buttons to initiate an immediate action; use a button for that.

### Toggles (NSSwitch)

- **Do** use NSSwitch for feature-level on/off settings that apply immediately.
- **Do** use it for settings analogous to iOS Settings app toggles (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, notifications).
- **Don't** use it for minor or detail-level options.
- **Don't** mix switches and checkboxes in the same list or form for the same semantic purpose.
- **Don't** use NSSwitch to control subordinate settings — use checkboxes with hierarchy for that.
- **Don't** deploy NSSwitch in apps targeting macOS before 10.15 Catalina.

### Date Pickers

- **Do** use `textFieldAndStepper` when space is at a premium and users enter specific known dates.
- **Do** use `clockAndCalendar` when browsing is the primary interaction model.
- **Don't** use `clockAndCalendar` for dates of birth or historically distant dates — the browsing overhead is too high.
- **Do** configure `datePickerElements` to show only the relevant components (don't show time if you don't need it).

### Sliders

- **Do** use a directional thumb when tick marks are present.
- **Do** use a round thumb when no tick marks are present.
- **Do** label at least the minimum and maximum value points when tick marks are displayed.
- **Do** use a circular slider for angle or rotation values.
- **Don't** use a slider when the user needs to enter a precise known value — use a stepper or text field.
- **Don't** use tick marks without labels unless the values are self-evident from position alone.

### Steppers

- **Do** always pair a stepper with a text field showing the current value.
- **Do** keep the gap at exactly 2 px (regular/small) between stepper and text field.
- **Do** support direct text field editing with matching value validation.
- **Don't** use a stepper for large continuous ranges — use a slider.
- **Don't** place a stepper without a visible current-value display.

### Color Wells

- **Do** use `NSColorWell.Style.minimal` in dense inspector panels.
- **Do** use `NSColorWell.Style.expanded` when a richer color selection experience is appropriate.
- **Don't** use a color well as a general-purpose button or label.
- **Do** allow drag-and-drop between color wells when multiple appear in the same window.

## 11. Level Indicators (NSLevelIndicator)

Display-only or interactive control showing a value within a finite range. macOS 10.4+.

### Styles

| Style | Visual | Editable | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.continuousCapacity` | Solid bar, color changes at warning/critical thresholds | No | Disk usage, memory, audio levels |
| `.discreteCapacity` | N rectangular segments, filled in steps | No | Battery, signal strength, progress |
| `.rating` | Star row (customizable images) | Yes (click) | Star ratings, quality ranking |
| `.relevancy` | Proportional bar segments decreasing in prominence | No | Search relevance, match strength |

### Key Properties

```swift
indicator.style = .continuousCapacity
indicator.minValue = 0; indicator.maxValue = 100
indicator.warningValue = 70    // yellow
indicator.criticalValue = 90   // red
indicator.doubleValue = 45
indicator.fillColor = .systemGreen
indicator.warningFillColor = .systemOrange
indicator.criticalFillColor = .systemRed

// Rating style (macOS 10.13+)
indicator.ratingImage = NSImage(named: "StarFilled")
indicator.ratingPlaceholderImage = NSImage(named: "StarEmpty")
indicator.isEditable = true
```

### Dimensions

| Control size | Approximate height |
|---|---|
| Regular | ~18 pt |
| Small | ~12 pt |
| Mini | ~10 pt |

### SwiftUI: Use `Gauge` (macOS 13+)

```swift
Gauge(value: usedGB, in: 0...100) { Text("Storage") }
    .gaugeStyle(.linearCapacity)
```

## 12. Path Controls (NSPathControl)

Breadcrumb navigation bar showing a file-system path. macOS 10.5+.

### Styles

| Style | Visual | Click behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `.standard` | All components with icons + chevrons | Click navigates to that ancestor |
| `.popUp` | Only last component shown as button | Click opens full-path popup + "Choose..." |
| `.none` | No built-in styling | Custom rendering |

### Usage

```swift
let pathControl = NSPathControl()
pathControl.pathStyle = .standard
pathControl.url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/Users/alice/Documents/README.md")
pathControl.target = self
pathControl.action = #selector(pathClicked(_:))

@objc func pathClicked(_ sender: NSPathControl) {
    guard let url = sender.clickedPathItem?.url else { return }
    NSWorkspace.shared.open(url)
}
```

### Dimensions

| Control size | Approximate height |
|---|---|
| Regular | ~22 pt |
| Small | ~18 pt |
| Mini | ~13 pt |

Truncates intermediate components when too wide, always showing first and last.

### SwiftUI

No built-in equivalent. Use `NSViewRepresentable` wrapper.

### Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `.standard` for breadcrumb navigation, `.popUp` for compact pickers
- **Do** implement drag-and-drop delegate for file-selection paths
- **Don't** use NSPathControl as a file picker replacement — use NSOpenPanel directly
- **Don't** use `.none` unless building a fully custom renderer
