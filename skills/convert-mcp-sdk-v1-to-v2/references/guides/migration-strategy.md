# Migration Strategy

Pick the right path *before* touching code. Wrong choice here costs days of churn later.

## Pre-migration audit

Before choosing, answer four questions about the v1 server in scope:

1. **Surface area.** How many `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/*` import sites? How many handler files? More than ~10 import sites or ~5 handlers tilts toward a staged migration — big-bang rewrites become fragile.
2. **OAuth.** Does the server use `mcpAuthRouter`, `OAuthServerProvider`, or `requireBearerAuth`? If yes, the auth path becomes the critical decision (see "Auth-heavy production servers" below).
3. **Production traffic.** Live customers, or a side project? Live traffic forces a staged migration with a working rollback. Side projects can take the full-rewrite hit.
4. **Alpha tolerance.** v2 is at `2.0.0-alpha.2` as of 2026-05-08, milestone `v2.0.0-bc`. If your team can't accept "the SDK might break between alpha versions," delay the migration entirely.

## Four strategies

### 1. Stay on v1 (do nothing yet)

The right call when:

- Server is in production with live traffic.
- v2 alpha cadence (breaking changes between alphas) is unacceptable.
- OAuth router usage is heavy and no verified transition package covers your custom provider.

You lose nothing by waiting. v1 is still on `main` (well, the `v1.x` branch) and supports the latest spec (2025-11-25). Re-evaluate when v2 publishes its first non-alpha release. Use the `build-mcp-server-sdk-v1` skill for ongoing work.

### 2. Full rewrite (small servers)

Replace every v1 import with v2, rewrite every handler, remove `mcpAuthRouter`, ship in one PR.

Right when:

- ≤200 LOC of tool/resource code.
- ≤2 transports.
- No OAuth router, or you're happy to replace it with HTTP-layer auth.
- Comprehensive test suite that gives confidence in one large diff.

Wrong when any of those don't hold. The temptation is "it'll be cleaner" — true, but the cleanup cost is paid in a single fragile PR.

### 3. Meta-package shim if published (medium servers)

Use this only when the target alpha actually publishes a `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` meta-package that re-exports v1 import paths under v2 internals. As of npm verification on 2026-05-09, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@2.0.0-alpha.2` is not published, so direct package migration or staying on v1 are the available paths.

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "2.0.0-alpha.N"  // only after npm confirms this target alpha exists
  }
}
```

If the target alpha publishes the shim, use this migration sequence:

1. Bump `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to the v2 meta-package version. Keep all imports as `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js` etc. Run tests — they should pass.
2. Pick one handler. Rewrite its imports to the new packages, schema to Zod v4 / `z.object()`, handler to `(args, ctx)`. Run that handler's tests.
3. Repeat per handler.
4. After all handlers are migrated, move transport, then framework wiring, then auth.
5. Remove the meta-package dependency. Pin to direct v2 packages.

Right when: medium codebase, OAuth absent or replaceable, you want to test runtime behavior on v2 *before* committing to the full rewrite.

### 4. Auth-heavy production servers

As of npm verification on 2026-05-09, `@modelcontextprotocol/server-auth-legacy` is not published. If a later target alpha publishes a verified transition package, v2 can connect through it while everything else migrates. Otherwise, stay on v1 until auth can move to the HTTP layer.

```typescript
// v1: built-in
import { mcpAuthRouter } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/router.js";

// Conditional future v2 transition: same router, frozen package
import { mcpAuthRouter } from "@modelcontextprotocol/server-auth-legacy";
```

Right when: existing OAuth router is load-bearing for live customers and a verified transition package exists for the target alpha.

The legacy package is a transition tool, not a destination. Plan a follow-up to migrate auth to a dedicated AS (custom Bearer + jose, Passport, Auth0/Okta external, or better-auth's eventual OAuth Provider Plugin) once v2 reaches stable.

## Strategy decision matrix

| Server profile | Recommended strategy |
|---|---|
| Side project, <200 LOC, no OAuth | Full rewrite |
| Internal tool, <500 LOC, basic Bearer auth | Full rewrite or verified meta-package |
| Production, <1000 LOC, no OAuth router | Verified meta-package shim, or direct packages if no shim exists |
| Production, OAuth router in use | Stay on v1, or HTTP-layer auth transition in a separate migration |
| Production, custom OAuth provider | Stay on v1 until v2 stable |
| OAuth-heavy enterprise | Stay on v1 until v2 stable |

## Recording the choice

Whatever you pick, write it in the migration PR description and commit it to the repo (e.g. `MIGRATION.md` or in `CHANGELOG`). Future maintainers — including you in three months — need to know which strategy is in flight to make sense of the import paths and dependency versions.

## When to abort and roll back

Abort criteria during the migration:

- A v2 alpha publishes a breaking change to an API you depend on (check the v2 changelog before each migration sprint).
- Test coverage drops below your team's threshold during the port.
- Production error rates rise on the staging environment.

Roll-back path: revert the `@modelcontextprotocol/*` dependency bumps, revert handler rewrites, redeploy. The meta-package strategy makes this cheaper than the full-rewrite strategy because un-migrated code paths still match v1 shapes.
