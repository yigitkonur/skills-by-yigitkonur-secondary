# Decoding
Decode unknown data at system boundaries and choose sync, Effect, Promise, Either, or Option helpers deliberately.

## Canonical import

Use the Effect v3 package barrel for normal Schema code:

```typescript
import { Schema } from "effect"
```

## Key rules

- **Boundary default:** Use `Schema.decodeUnknown*` for HTTP bodies, config, files, queues, and any value typed unknown.
- **Typed input:** Use `Schema.decode*` only when TypeScript already knows the encoded input type.
- **Sync helpers:** Use sync only when all schema work is synchronous.
- **Either and Option:** Use Either to keep parse details, Option when presence is all that matters.
- **Promise helper:** Use promise helpers at non-Effect framework edges.

## Example

```typescript
import { Schema } from "effect"

const User = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.UUID.pipe(Schema.brand("UserId")),
  email: Schema.String.pipe(Schema.pattern(/^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/))
})

const parseUserSync = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(User)
const parseUserEither = Schema.decodeUnknownEither(User)
const parseUserOption = Schema.decodeUnknownOption(User)
const parseUserPromise = Schema.decodeUnknownPromise(User)

const valid = parseUserSync({
  id: "2f4b2c0e-04d9-4c21-87d7-f49838c47f25",
  email: "ada@example.com"
})
```

## Operational guidance

- `decodeUnknown` returns an Effect value and preserves parse failure in the error channel.
- `decodeUnknownSync` throws on parse failure, so reserve it for scripts, tests, or framework edges that expect exceptions.
- `decodeUnknownEither` is useful in pure adapters and tests because it exposes success or parse failure without running Effect.
- `decodeUnknownOption` discards parse details; use it only when diagnostics are not needed.
- `decodeUnknownPromise` bridges to async framework APIs that are not Effect-native.
- `decode` has the same helper family but expects the schema encoded input type rather than arbitrary unknown.
- Do not use `decode` for request bodies simply because TypeScript has an interface; the runtime value is still unknown.
- Decode once at the edge, then pass the decoded domain type.
- Choose `{ errors: "all" }` when user-facing forms need all field failures.
- Choose default first-error behavior for hot paths or internal boundaries where one failure is enough.
- Use `{ onExcessProperty: "error" }` when additional keys must be rejected.
- Use parser annotations to tune nested parse behavior where one field needs a different setting.
- Do not wrap parsing in imperative exception handling inside Effect code; keep parse failure in Effect or Either.
- If a transform needs services, the decoder result will require that environment.
- Name decoder functions after the boundary: `decodeWebhook`, `decodeConfig`, `decodeRequestBody`.
- Keep schemas separate from framework request objects; parse the extracted data shape.
- For generated clients, decode responses too; external services can drift.
- For config, prefer Config integration where available and Schema decoding for structured payloads.
- For message queues, decode at consumer start before dispatching to domain handlers.
- For tests, assert both accepted and rejected examples for every boundary schema.
- Check `Decoding` schemas at the boundary where unknown data first appears.
- Keep schema names stable when generated artifacts or external clients depend on them.
- Prefer named reusable schemas over repeating inline validators in several files.
- Verify at least one valid value and one invalid value when the schema guards a public boundary.
- Keep transforms, filters, and brands separated so the reason for each constraint is visible.
- Use annotations when generated documentation, formatter output, or client contracts need metadata.
- Do not add compatibility branches unless an existing external contract requires them.
- Keep decoded domain values free of nullish sentinel values unless the domain explicitly models them.
- When source and older examples disagree, follow the Effect v3 source.
- If a schema becomes hard to read, extract smaller named schemas instead of adding comments around complexity.
