# Equivalence And Order
Derive equality from schemas and supply ordering separately when sorted collections need it.

## Canonical import

Use the Effect v3 package barrel for normal Schema code:

```typescript
import { Schema } from "effect"
```

## Key rules

- **Equivalence:** Schema can derive an Equivalence for decoded values.
- **Annotations:** Use equivalence annotations when domain equality differs from structural equality.
- **Order:** Ordering is not the same as equality; provide an Order when APIs such as SortedSet need one.
- **Collections:** HashMap and HashSet schemas include equivalence support for contained values.
- **Testing:** Use derived equality in tests when raw object identity would be misleading.

## Example

```typescript
import { Schema } from "effect"

const Email = Schema.String.pipe(
  Schema.pattern(/^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/),
  Schema.brand("Email")
).annotations({ identifier: "Email" })

const User = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.UUID.pipe(Schema.brand("UserId")),
  email: Email
}).annotations({ identifier: "User" })

const sameUser = Schema.equivalence(User)
```

## Operational guidance

- Use `Schema.equivalence(schema)` when structural equality should follow the schema shape.
- Derived equality compares decoded values, not arbitrary encoded input.
- Use an `equivalence` annotation to override a field or custom schema when equality has domain rules.
- Do not use JSON stringification as equality for schema values; it is order-sensitive and transform-blind.
- Ordering requires an Order instance, especially for sorted collections.
- For sorted sets, pass an Order appropriate to the decoded item type.
- Keep equality and ordering definitions close to the schema when they define domain semantics.
- Use case-insensitive email equivalence only if the domain explicitly owns that normalization rule.
- For branded primitives, equality usually follows the underlying primitive.
- For classes, derived equivalence should compare schema fields, not object identity.
- For recursive schemas, watch for cycles when deriving or using equality.
- When equality is used for cache keys, document the stability requirements.
- Check `Equivalence And Order` schemas at the boundary where unknown data first appears.
- Keep schema names stable when generated artifacts or external clients depend on them.
- Prefer named reusable schemas over repeating inline validators in several files.
- Verify at least one valid value and one invalid value when the schema guards a public boundary.
- Keep transforms, filters, and brands separated so the reason for each constraint is visible.
- Use annotations when generated documentation, formatter output, or client contracts need metadata.
- Do not add compatibility branches unless an existing external contract requires them.
- Keep decoded domain values free of nullish sentinel values unless the domain explicitly models them.
- When source and older examples disagree, follow the Effect v3 source.
- If a schema becomes hard to read, extract smaller named schemas instead of adding comments around complexity.
