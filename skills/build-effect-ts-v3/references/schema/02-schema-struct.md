# Schema.Struct
Use Schema.Struct for plain decoded data records and understand when Schema.Class is the better fit.

## Canonical import

Use the Effect v3 package barrel for normal Schema code:

```typescript
import { Schema } from "effect"
```

## Key rules

- **Struct purpose:** `Schema.Struct` describes object shape; it does not create a domain class or attach behavior.
- **Fields:** Each property is a schema or a property signature such as `Schema.optional`.
- **Optional properties:** Use `Schema.optional` for missing-or-undefined input and `Schema.optionalWith` for exact, nullable, defaulted, or Option-shaped fields.
- **Unknown keys:** Parsing ignores excess properties by default; tighten parse options at boundaries when rejecting extras matters.
- **Struct versus Class:** Use Struct for transport DTOs and persisted records; use Class when constructors, getters, methods, or subclassing matter.

## Example

```typescript
import { Schema } from "effect"

const UserPatch = Schema.Struct({
  displayName: Schema.optional(Schema.NonEmptyString),
  avatarUrl: Schema.optionalWith(Schema.String, { exact: true }),
  timezone: Schema.optionalWith(Schema.NonEmptyString, {
    default: () => "UTC"
  })
})

type UserPatch = Schema.Schema.Type<typeof UserPatch>

const patch = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(UserPatch)({
  displayName: "Ada",
  timezone: "Europe/London"
})
```

## Operational guidance

- `Schema.Struct({ field: Schema.String })` means the field is required in decoded and encoded forms.
- `Schema.optional(Schema.String)` accepts an absent property and exposes `string | undefined`.
- `Schema.optionalWith(schema, { exact: true })` models a property that may be absent without widening the field value with `undefined`.
- `Schema.optionalWith(schema, { nullable: true })` accepts nullish wire input when the boundary requires it.
- `Schema.optionalWith(schema, { as: "Option" })` gives an Option-valued decoded field without pushing null into the domain.
- `Schema.optionalWith(schema, { default: () => value })` makes a required decoded field with a constructor or decoding default.
- Use property annotations on fields when JSON Schema or formatter output needs field-level titles.
- Use schema annotations on the whole struct for identifiers and public docs.
- Keep struct schemas close to external boundary types; do not add methods by wrapping Struct in object helpers.
- When methods are needed, move to `Schema.Class` instead of bolting behavior onto plain records.
- When variants are needed, compose Struct with `Schema.Union` or use `Schema.TaggedClass`.
- When entity IDs appear, reference branded schemas instead of repeating string validators.
- For update payloads, prefer a dedicated patch Struct over making the creation Struct partial by habit.
- For strict input rejection, pass parse options at the boundary and document why unknown keys must fail.
- Do not encode persistence-only nullability into the domain type; transform it at the persistence adapter.
- Struct field names are the external contract, so renaming them is a migration, not a refactor.
- Use `Schema.rename` only for explicit wire-to-domain key mapping; otherwise keep the shape direct.
- Prefer small structs composed into larger structs over one giant boundary schema.
- When a struct is reused by several endpoints, annotate it with an identifier before generating JSON Schema.
- Compare with `Schema.Class`: Class creates instances and supports getters/methods, Struct produces plain data.
- Check `Schema.Struct` schemas at the boundary where unknown data first appears.
- Keep schema names stable when generated artifacts or external clients depend on them.
- Prefer named reusable schemas over repeating inline validators in several files.
- Verify at least one valid value and one invalid value when the schema guards a public boundary.
- Keep transforms, filters, and brands separated so the reason for each constraint is visible.
- Use annotations when generated documentation, formatter output, or client contracts need metadata.
- Do not add compatibility branches unless an existing external contract requires them.
- Keep decoded domain values free of nullish sentinel values unless the domain explicitly models them.
- When source and older examples disagree, follow the Effect v3 source.
- If a schema becomes hard to read, extract smaller named schemas instead of adding comments around complexity.
